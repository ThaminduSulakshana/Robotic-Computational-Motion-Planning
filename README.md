# Robotic Computational Motion Planning

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and resources related to Motion Planning for robotic systems. Motion Planning refers to the problem of determining a robot's actions to achieve specified goals, given its environment and constraints.

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **Graph-based Methods**: Algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* for pathfinding.
2. **Randomized Planners**: Techniques such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) for exploring the space of possible paths.
3. **Artificial Potential Fields**: Using potential functions to guide a robot towards its goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Contents
- `graph_based_methods/`: Implementations of pathfinding algorithms using graphs.
- `randomized_planners/`: Code for randomized path planning techniques.
- `potential_fields/`: Implementations of artificial potential fields for navigation.
- `examples/`: Example scenarios and simulations demonstrating the different planning methods.
